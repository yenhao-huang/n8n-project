### 🛠️ Tool 1: **RAG Company AI**

A document-aware AI assistant for internal corporate Q&A.

#### Workflow Overview:

Phase I
1. A file is added or updated in Google Drive
2. The document is downloaded → split into chunks → embedded using OpenAI
3. Embeddings are stored in Pinecone Vector Store

Phase II
1. Telegram receives a user question
2. The question is embedded and sent to Pinecone for semantic search
3. Relevant chunks are retrieved → passed to OpenAI → response is generated

#### 🧠 Example:

1. A user uploads a document to Google Drive.  
2. The Company AI ingests and stores the knowledge.  
3. Later, another user asks a question and receives an instant, AI-generated answer.

**Results:**
